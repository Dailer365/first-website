        <h2>3 Tips for Making Minestrone Soup You Actually Want to Eat</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <p>
                    <strong>1.Cook vegetables in stages.</strong>The key to a soup that actually has texture (and isn’t just a broth filled with<br>
                    mushy vegetables) is to add the vegetables in stages. Begin with a mirepoix — the classic trio of onion,<br>
                    celery, and carrot — which boosts the flavor of the store-bought broth. Next, add long-cooking, dense<br>
                    vegetables, like sweet potatoes or winter squash. Finally, stir in tender vegetables, like zucchini and garlic<br>
                    (which is prone to burning). You’ll cook each round until the vegetables brighten in color and just begin to<br>
                    soften, about 3 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>2.Add flavor at every step.</strong>Sautéing the vegetables in both <u>olive oil</u> and butter adds richness and body<br>
                    to the soup from the get-go. Adding in a Parmesan rind gives the broth a big boost, as does store-bought<br>
                    pesto. Pesto is packed with concentrated flavor, thanks to chopped herbs, nuts, and cheese. It also gives the<br>
                    soup a rich consistency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3.Leave out the pasta (or serve it on the side):</strong>Many minestrone recipes are made with short pasta,<br>
                    but here, we opt for creamy cannellini beans. Pasta can absorb a lot of the broth, especially if you’re storing<br>
                    leftovers or freezing the soup, making it mushy. But if you insist on noodles in your soup, cook short noodles<br>
                    (I recommend ditalini or macaroni) separately and stir them into the soup upon serving.
                </p>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Storing Minestrone Soup</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                This soup will thicken in the refrigerator as the residual heat of the broth continues to cook the vegetables<br>
                and they release their starches, so stir in another splash of <u>broth</u>when you reheat leftovers.<br>
                If you’re meal prepping this soup or making it ahead of time, cool the soup, then pack into deli containers or<br>
                ladle into freezer-safe zip-top bags. Lay the bags flat on a baking sheet and freeze. Once solid, they can be<br>
                stored vertically in the freezer where they take up less space and are easy to thaw.
