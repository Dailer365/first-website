        <h2>Tools You Need to Make Kimbap</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>A bamboo rolling mat is the only specialized equipment you need, but even that can be improvised. In a<br>
                pinch you might use a sheet of aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or even your hands to make a looser, slightly<br>
                more rustic roll. A bamboo mat is inexpensive, though, and I do recommend picking one up from a Korean<br>
                or Japanese market, a well-stocked cooking store, or online.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Season the rice.</strong>In a small bowl, stir the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until the sugar dissolves.<br>
                        Pour it over the warm rice along with 1 teaspoon of sesame seeds and gently but thoroughly<br>
                        mix together. Let cool.<br>
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Organize your workspace.</strong>Arrange your ingredients and tools so that everything will be<br>
                        close at hand when needed. Place the bamboo rolling mat on a flat surface with the long side<br>
                        nearest you (the bamboo sticks should be horizontal). Lay out the seaweed sheets, a plate or<br>
                        tray with fillings, and a small bowl of warm water. Also designate a place to put your finished<br>
                        rolls.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <P>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Position the seaweed on top of the bamboo mat.</strong>With dry hands, place one sheet of<br>
                        seaweed on the bamboo rolling mat with the shiny side down and the long side nearest you.
                    </li>
                </P>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Spread a layer of rice on top of the seaweed.</strong>Lightly moisten your hands with water and<br>
                        evenly spread one-fifth of the rice (about 2/3 cup) on the lower two-thirds of the seaweed,<br>
                        leaving the top third of the seaweed empty. If the rice sticks to your fingers as you work, lightly<br>
                        dip them in water (avoid using too much water as it can make the seaweed soggy).
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Arrange the fillings on top of the rice.</strong>About an inch up from the bottom of the rice,<br>
                        arrange the fillings in neat, horizontal rows.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Begin rolling.</strong>Beginning on the side nearest you, roll the bamboo mat up and over the fillings.<br>
                        Use firm but gentle pressure to hold the ingredients in place.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Continue rolling.</strong>As you're rolling forward, pull the mat up and out so it doesn't get caught in<br>
                        the roll. Keep rolling and releasing the mat until you form a compact cylinder.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Seal and season the roll.</strong>Dip your finger in water and moisten the edge of the seaweed to<br>
                        seal the roll. Wrap the entire bamboo mat around the roll and give it a firm but gentle squeeze.<br>
                        Using your hands or a pastry brush, lightly coat the outside of the roll with sesame oil to give it<br>
                        shine and prevent it from drying out. Set it aside.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cut into bite-size pieces.</strong> Begin cutting when all the rolls are complete. Using a towel or<br>
                        pastry brush, coat the blade of the knife with a thin layer of sesame oil. Slice the roll into bite-<br>
                        size pieces, periodically wiping the blade and re-applying sesame oil to prevent sticking.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Garnish with sesame seeds (optional).</strong>Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds over the cut rolls.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Serve.</strong>Serve gimbap at room temperature. Best eaten the same day.
