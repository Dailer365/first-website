        <h2>How Is Kimchi Made?</h2>
        <p>Cabbage kimchi is made by
            <strong>lacto-fermentation</strong>
            :<ul>
                <li>Stage one: Nappa cabbage is soaked in a salty brine that kills harmful bacteria.</li>
                <li>Stage two: the remaining good bacteria (Lactobacillus) convert sugars into lactic acid,<br>
                    preserving the vegetables and giving them their tangy flavor.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Two Main Steps for Making Kimchi</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Baechu, or <u>napa cabbage</u>, kimchi is made by lacto-fermentation, the same process that creates<br></li>
                <li><u>sauerkraut</u> and traditional <u>dill pickles</u>.</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>In the first stage, the cabbage is soaked in a salty brine that kills off harmful bacteria.</li>
                <li>In the second stage, the remaining Lactobacillus bacteria (the good guys!) convert sugars into lactic<br>
                     acid, which preserves the vegetables and gives them that wonderful, tangy flavor.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>What Ingredients Are in Kimchi?</h2>
        <p>
            While questioning my Korean family and friends about kimchi, I have received all<br>
            kinds of opinions. Some cooks swear by a little bit of sugar, others completely<br>
            shun sweeteners. There are people who include carrots and there are people who<br>
            wrinkle their noses at the idea.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m a vegetarian and my mother-in-law happily makes fish- and shrimp-free<br>
            kimchi for me, but I’m sure some would consider it blasphemy to leave out the<br>
            seafood. (I like adding a bit of kelp powder for umami flavor.)
